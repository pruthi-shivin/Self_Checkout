# Self-Checkout Kiosk for Fruits using AI and IoT

This project presents a smart, AI-powered self-checkout system designed to automate the billing process for fresh produce in supermarkets. Using computer vision and machine learning, the kiosk identifies fruits placed under a camera, calculates the price based on weight, and generates a billing interface â€” minimizing manual labor and queue times.

## Features

- Real-time fruit identification using a CNN-based image classification model (MobileNetV2).
- Flask web app for image upload and prediction.
- USB camera integration for live fruit detection (`live_predict.py`).
- HTML/CSS-based user interface with prediction display.
- Easily integrable with weighing scale hardware (IoT).
- Custom-trained model (`fruit_model_mobilenet.h5`) on real fruit images.

## Setup Instructions

1. Download the zip file and extract it in your pc
2. Open VS Code and open the folder.
3. Install required packages
   
   pip install tensorflow flask opencv-python numpy

4. Run the flask app

   python app.py

5. Access it on 127.0.0.1:5000 (in the terminal)
6. To test with live camera

   python live_predict.py



Demo

Upload or capture a fruit image.

The system predicts the fruit name with confidence.

Can be extended to weigh the fruit and calculate total price.
